## Boss Machine
### Project - Codecademy [JavaScript Back-End Development](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/web-development/tracks/javascript-back-end-development/modules/express-cumulative-project/informationals/bapi-p4-boss-machine)

The objective of this project was to create an entire API to serve information to a Boss Machine, a unique management application for today's most accomplished (evil) entrepreneurs.  

The API provides CRUD logic for 'minions', 'million dollar ideas' and 'meetings' in a SQLite database.

The project involved setting up server middleware, API routes and integrating with the 'database' javascript file.

To execute on your local machine:
1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
2. Run `npm run start` to start the API server
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser to launch the application

Additionally, a Mocha/Chai test suite is included, run `npm test` to execute.
